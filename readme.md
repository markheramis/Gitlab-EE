# GITLAB EE

This compose project is an implementation to create a self-hosted Gitlab EE deployment for on your local or as a self-hosted machine within your company's cloud.

To deploy, its as easy as copying the `.env.example` file and modifying it to your preferences.

Then hit the command

```bash
docker-compose up
```

and you're good to go.

*NOTE* you need [Docker] for this to work.
